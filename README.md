# Advent-of-Code-2022-Python-
Repository for my attempts at the AoC 2022 while practicing Python. 


My attempts at solving the Advent Of Code 2022 challenges.

I use this to develop my basic Python skills, so don't expect fancy code. 
I will keep trying until the solution is way over my skill level, or more important stuff gets in the way.
I will try to add as many comments as possible for my own sake. 

Any feedback is much appreciated
